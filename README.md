# Stardew Valley Checklist
This is a checklist for bundles in Stardew Valley, it basically contains all the items required to complete the community center in the game. It's not finished yet, you can see it by the ugly UI design :smiley:

## Tech
It uses React.js, HTML and CSS. There's no database for it because the data is storage on web cookies.

## How to run?
1. Download the project
2. Run `npm install` on the downloaded folder
3. Run `npm start`
4. It's running. To stop, just `CTRL-C` on command prompt
